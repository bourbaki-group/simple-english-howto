How to write or translate into Simple English
=============================================

Simple English in three rules
-----------------------------

1. Use words in the [Basic English wordlist](https://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Basic_English_combined_wordlist&oldid=5826355)
   or [VOA Special English wordlist](https://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:VOA_Special_English_Word_Book&oldid=4398542).
2. Write using simple sentences.
3. Words essential to the document may be preserved. For example, if an article is about the workings of the Saturn V rocket, you would use (and explain)
   the words "Saturn V" and "rocket." You might also use (and explain) terms such as "atmosphere" or "orbit".

Example of a document written in Simple English: ["Many Monarch Butterflies Not Flying South for Winter"](https://learningenglish.voanews.com/a/many-monarch-butterflies-not-flying-south-for-winter/4089435.html)

Advice on translating into Simple English
-----------------------------------------

1. Check your sentences with the online tool http://159.203.90.186:5000/ . If the tool makes mistakes, report them here.
2. Keep words from the original if they are valid words. "The house is on the border of Cobb County." is acceptable because "border" is in the VOA Special English wordlist. One does not need to change it (e.g., by replacing "border" with "edge").
3. Keep important details from the original. Avoid simplifying too much. For example, "I did not move around until I was 18 years old when I went to Syracuse University, so my neighborhood is very clear to me." certainly needs to be broken up into at least two sentences. The sentences should contain the specific details "18 years old" and "Syracuse University".


Data format for Simple English Translations

Unless otherwise noted, the following format is used to store translations in a text file. The original sentence is followed by the translated sentence (or sentences). These sentences are, collectively, an *example*. A blank line separates examples.

This sketch illustrates the idea:

```
